## DESCRIPTION:
This project is a tile based endless runner video game implemented by only using python's pygame module.
Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules which is used to create video games. It consists of computer graphics and sound libraries designed to be used with the Python programming language.

## INSTALLATION:
### Install pygame in Windows or MacOS
- Before installing Pygame, Python should be installed in the system, and it is good to have 3.6.1 or above version because it is much friendlier to beginners, and additionally runs faster.
- Installing through pip: The good way to install Pygame is with the pip tool (which is what python uses to install packages). The command is the following:

```
py -m pip install -U pygame --user  
```
or 
```
"python directory which you are going to run this game on" pip install pygame   
```
